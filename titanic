Random Forest 

891 samples
  6 predictor
  2 classes: '0', '1' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) 
Summary of sample sizes: 713, 712, 712, 713, 714 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  mtry  Accuracy   Kappa    
  2     0.8126084  0.5855450
  5     0.8102858  0.5907004
  8     0.8125142  0.5969420

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
The final value used for the model was mtry = 2.
